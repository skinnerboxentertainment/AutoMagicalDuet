# Gameplay Code Rules

- ALL gameplay values MUST come from external config/data files, NEVER hardcoded
- Use delta time for ALL time-dependent calculations (frame-rate independence)
- NO direct references to UI code — use events/signals for cross-system communication
- Every gameplay system must implement a clear interface
- State machines must have explicit transition tables with documented states
- Write unit tests for all gameplay logic — separate logic from presentation
- Document which design doc each feature implements in code comments
- No static singletons for game state — use dependency injection

## Examples

**Correct** (data-driven):

```typescript
const damage: number = config.getValue("combat", "baseDamage", 10)
const speed: number = stats.movementSpeed * delta
```

**Incorrect** (hardcoded):

```typescript
const damage: number = 25     // VIOLATION: hardcoded gameplay value
const speed: number = 5.0     // VIOLATION: not from config, not using delta
```
