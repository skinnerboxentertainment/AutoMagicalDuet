# Test Standards

- Test naming: `test_[system]_[scenario]_[expected_result]` pattern
- Every test must have a clear arrange/act/assert structure
- Unit tests must not depend on external state (filesystem, network, database)
- Integration tests must clean up after themselves
- Performance tests must specify acceptable thresholds and fail if exceeded
- Test data must be defined in the test or in dedicated fixtures, never shared mutable state
- Mock external dependencies — tests should be fast and deterministic
- Every bug fix must have a regression test that would have caught the original bug

## Examples

**Correct** (proper naming + Arrange/Act/Assert):

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect } from "vitest"
import { HealthComponent } from "../src/gameplay/health-component"

describe("HealthComponent", () => {
  it("test_health_takeDamage_reducesHealth", () => {
    // Arrange
    const health = new HealthComponent()
    health.maxHealth = 100
    health.currentHealth = 100

    // Act
    health.takeDamage(25)

    // Assert
    expect(health.currentHealth).toBe(75)
  })
})
```

**Incorrect**:

```typescript
it("test1", () => {
  // VIOLATION: no descriptive name
  const h = new HealthComponent()
  h.takeDamage(25) // VIOLATION: no arrange step, no clear assert
  expect(h.currentHealth).toBeLessThan(100) // VIOLATION: imprecise assertion
})
```
